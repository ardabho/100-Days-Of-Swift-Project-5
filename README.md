# Anagram Finder
100-Days-Of-Swift-Project-5

A game where you derive new words from the word given in the title. 
You can use the plus button to add a new word, and the refresh button to get a new word.
3 things are checked every time you upload a new word:
  -If it's possible to derive from the given words letters,
  -If it's used before,
  -If it's an actual word.
Final one is checked with UITextChecker.
