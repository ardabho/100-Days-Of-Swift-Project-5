# Anagram Finder
100-Days-Of-Swift-Project-5

A game where you derive new words from the word given in the title. <br />
You can use the plus button to add a new word, and the refresh button to get a new word. <br /> <br />
3 things are checked every time you upload a new word: <br />
_-If it's possible to derive from the given words letters, <br />_
_-If it's used before, <br />_
_-If it's an actual word. <br />_
Final one is checked with UITextChecker. <br />
